            The City of York, Pennsylvania – named for York, England – was part of the building of our nation, a little-known part of history that many tend to forget, or just don’t know. As Yorkers know, their City was the birthplace of the Articles of Confederation and it was here that the words “The United States of America” were first spoken.
            In September of 1777 the Continental Congress, under threat of the advancing British, moved the location of the colonies’ central government from Philadelphia to Lancaster. Since the State of Pennsylvania’s Government was also located in Lancaster, officials decided that a move across the Susquehanna would separate the two sufficiently and the Continental Congress set up shop in the Town of York.
            It was in York that the Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, proclaimed the first National Day of Thanksgiving, and signed the French Treaty of Alliance. All of these events occurred in the nine months York remained Capital of the United States – until June 27, 1778. That is where The City of York made history for the United States, … But since then, York has been part of the growth of this nation as well as the growth of its inhabitants.

        <h2>Firsts of the 1700's</h2>

        <p class="history1">
            First city – When York city was first laid out in 1741 by Thomas Cookson, 
            and the first lots were offered for sale, 23 were promptly purchased in what became the first town west of the Susquehanna River.
        </p>

        <p class="history1">
            First church – “In September of 1733, the Lutherans took steps for the organization of a congregation, the first one of this denomination west of the Susquehanna,” wrote historian George Powell in Gibson’s 1886 History of York County. 
            “In 1744 the first log church was built in York, on the spot where the Christ Church stands.”
        </p>

        <p class="history1">
            First stone homes – The Schultz brothers built the first stone homes in York County in 1734. 
            John and Christina built a 2 1/2-story home, believed the first stone home west of the river. 
            It is just east of York, near Stony Brook. Martin Shultz built his stone dwelling in Hellam.

        <p class="history1">
            First roads – In 1739, an old Indian trail from Wrightsville to Maryland and Virginia was called the Monocacy Road. 
            It was the first road laid out in the present limits of York County, according to Gibson.

        <h2>Firsts of the 1800's</h2>

        <p class="history1">
            First hall – About 1812 Peter Wilt (owner of The Golden Lamb tavern on East Market Street) built a hall. 
            It was the first place of public entertainment so far as records go in the town of York.
        </p>

        <p class="history1">
            First coal – In 1818, having heard about “stone coal,” Wilt had a half of ton of it unloaded in front of his tavern. “Wilt invited his friends and neighbors into his tavern to see how he would start a fire,” Prowell wrote. 
            Wilt couldn’t get the coal to burn, and his guests, having taken a dram of spirits which cost three cents a glass, pronounced the cannon stove a failure. That year, George S. Morris was the first coal dealer in York.

        <p class="history1">
            First telegraph – The first telegraph line extended from Washington to Baltimore in 1844, and the first message sent was about President James Polk’s election. 
            By 1850 the line reached York, “and in September of that year, the first message was received in the York office,” Prowell wrote in another early Dispatch story. “Ovid Buckley was the first operator. 
            He had his instrument in a book store opposite the courthouse then owned by himself and Dr. W. S. Poland.”
        </p>

        <p class="history1">

        </p>

        <p class="history1">
            First telephone – During the fall of 1881, writes Prowell, “John K. Gross, the freight agent of the Northern Central Railway, introduced the telephone into York.” The first line extended from Railroad to Shrewsbury. 
            Gross brought the Bell Telephone into York City soon after, the first line “form the residence of Latimer Small, North George Street, to the Codorus mills three miles north of York.”
